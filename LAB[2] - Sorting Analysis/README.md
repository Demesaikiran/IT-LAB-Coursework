# Observations/ Self Analysis

## Lab2: Appreciating Best, Average and Worst Case Complexities

This is my self analysis on the experiment done for the various inputs as follows

>1. Input size 10
>2. Input size 100
>3. Input size 1000
>4. Input size 10000
>5. Input size 100000
>6. Input size 1000000
>7. Input size 10000000(`Calculated`)

On the algorithms,

>1. Bubble sort
>2. Insertion sort
>3. Selection sort


## Smaller Inputs analysis

For smaller inputs the bubble sort, selection sort and Insertion sort play similarly interms of time of execution, in that case considering the `cost of operations` we can choose bubble sort for smaller inputs of size less than `10000`.

## Larger Inputs analysis

Whereas for larger inputs `bubble sort` will outdate it's time of execution to very large and `selection sort` plays `better` role compared to bubble sort. Whereas `Insertion sort` will give you the output in very less time comparing with selection sort and bubble sort.

So for large inputs it is preferable that using insertion sort gives us faster response/ Output
